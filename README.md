This is an application, that allows a user to log in and keep track of their workout sessions.
This is only the MVP and plan to add more functionality to it in the near future. As of ow, 
you can register and log in as a unique user. Each user can create many workout sessions,
and multiple exercises in each workout session. In the their dashboard, it will show them the
last day tehy creaed a session as well as a break down of some of the session in graph form.

In the future, I would love to add more features to track their weight and
keep track of their progress along the way. It would also be great to break down
each exercise over a chosen amount of time and see that progress aswell.
